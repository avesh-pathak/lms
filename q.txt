🏆 Babua Premier League – Product Design Challenge

🎯 Core Objective
Design a Babua-styled Learning Management System (LMS) that delivers high-quality tech education for free, while also creating sustainable, student-friendly revenue streams without selling courses.

📚 Learning Scope (Free for All Users)
The platform should reflect the Babua mindset — practical, no-nonsense, community-driven, and focused on real engineering growth, not certificate selling.

💡 Revenue Innovation Challenge
Build a free-to-learn, Babua-branded LMS that offers structured, pattern-based content across core computer science and engineering topics, while innovating on ethical, low-cost monetization models that students genuinely feel happy to pay for.

🧠 What We Are Evaluating
Teams are encouraged to think beyond conventional LMS monetization.

🚫 What NOT to Build
❌ A traditional LMS that sells courses
❌ High-priced subscriptions
❌ Locked content behind paywalls
❌ Certificate-only value systems
